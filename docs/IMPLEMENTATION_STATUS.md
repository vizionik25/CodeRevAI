## Phase 1: Production Blockers ✅

**Status:** Complete  
**Completed:** October 18, 2025  
**Goal:** Fix critical production issues preventing stable deployment

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Standardize error responses** | ✅ Complete | Created `AppError` class with 13 error codes, `createErrorResponse` helper |
