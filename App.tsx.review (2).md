This is a well-structured React application that demonstrates integration with Google's GenAI for video generation and prompt optimization. The use of state management with `useState` and clear handler functions makes the logic relatively easy to follow. However, there are several areas that could be improved across bugs, performance, security, best practices, and maintainability.

---

## 1. Bugs and Errors

*   **`bloblToBase64` - Redundant `async` Keyword:**
    The `async` keyword on a function that directly returns a `Promise` created with `new Promise` is often redundant and can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior if not handled carefully (e.g., `await` inside the `Promise` constructor's executor function).
    *   **Issue:** The `async` keyword on `bloblToBase64` is unnecessary because you're explicitly returning a `new Promise`. The `await` inside the promise executor is also not strictly needed as `reader.readAsDataURL` doesn't return a promise.
    *   **Before:**
        ```typescript
        function bloblToBase64(blob: Blob) {
          return new Promise<string>(async (resolve) => {
            const reader = new FileReader();
            reader.onload = () => {
              const url = reader.result as string;
              resolve(url.split(',')[1]);
            };
            reader.readAsDataURL(blob);
          });
        }
        ```
    *   **After:**
        ```typescript
        function bloblToBase64(blob: Blob): Promise<string> {
          return new Promise((resolve) => {
            const reader = new FileReader();
            reader.onload = () => {
              // reader.result can be string or ArrayBuffer; ensure it's a string
              const url = reader.result as string; 
              resolve(url.split(',')[1]);
            };
            reader.readAsDataURL(blob);
          });
        }
        ```

*   **`generateVideoFromText` - Polling Delay Before First Check:**
    The `while (!operation.done)` loop unnecessarily introduces a 10-second delay *before* the first check of `operation.done` if the operation is already complete.
    *   **Issue:** If the video generation completes very quickly, the code will still wait for 10 seconds before proceeding.
    *   **Before:**
        ```typescript
        // ...
        while (!operation.done) {
          await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 10000)); // Delay here
          console.log('...Generating...');
          operation = await ai.operations.getVideosOperation({operation});
        }
        // ...
        ```
    *   **After:**
        ```typescript
        // ...
        // Check if done immediately. If not, then start polling.
        while (!operation.done) {
          console.log('...Generating...');
          await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 10000));
          operation = await ai.operations.getVideosOperation({operation});
        }
        // ...
        ```
        *Self-correction:* The current placement is actually better for *subsequent* checks, as it waits *before* fetching the *next* operation status. The initial `await ai.models.generateVideos` is the first check. The loop then waits and checks again. This is fine. The comment about "Delay Before First Check" is slightly inaccurate for this flow. The main performance point is the fixed 10s interval.

*   **`generateVideoFromText` - Inconsistent Use of `generatedVideos`:**
    The `generateVideoFromText` function returns `Promise<string[]>` and uses `Promise.all` on `videos.map`, implying it can handle multiple generated videos. However, `handleGenerateFromPrompt` and `handleSaveEdit` only ever use `videoObjects[0]`.
    *   **Issue:** If `numberOfVideos` were ever greater than 1, only the first video would be displayed. This might be intentional (only show one video at a time), but it's a potential mismatch between the function's capability and its usage. If the intention is always one video, `Promise.all` and the array return type are slightly over-engineered.
    *   **Suggestion:** Clarify the intent. If always one, simplify `generateVideoFromText` to return `Promise<string>` directly. If multiple, ensure the UI can handle and display them. For this review, assuming the intention is to always use the first generated video.

*   **`handleOptimizePrompt` - `response.text` Type Mismatch:**
    The Google GenAI library's `generateContent` method usually returns an object with methods like `text()` to extract content, rather than a direct `text` property.
    *   **Issue:** `response.text` might be `undefined` or incorrect based on the actual API client's return type. This would lead to runtime errors.
    *   **Before:**
        ```typescript
        // ...
        const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
          model: 'gemini-2.5-flash',
          contents: prompt,
          config: { /* ... */ },
        });

        const optimizedPrompt = response.text.trim(); // Potential bug here
        setPrompt(optimizedPrompt);
        // ...
        ```
    *   **After:**
        ```typescript
        // ...
        const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
          model: 'gemini-2.5-flash',
          contents: [{ type: 'text', text: prompt }], // Correct payload structure
          config: { /* ... */ },
        });

        const optimizedPrompt = (await response.text()).trim(); // Access with await response.text()
        setPrompt(optimizedPrompt);
        // ...
        ```
    *   *Note:* The `contents` field typically expects an array of parts, e.g., `[{ type: 'text', text: prompt }]`, rather than just the string `prompt`. Please verify the exact type signature for `GoogleGenAI.models.generateContent`.

*   **Environment Variable Access (`process.env.API_KEY`):**
    *   **Issue:** `process.env` is typically a Node.js concept. In client-side React applications, especially those built with tools like Vite, Create React App (CRA), or Next.js, environment variables are often accessed differently (e.g., `import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY` for Vite, `process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY` for CRA, `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY` for Next.js). If the current build setup doesn't correctly inject `process.env.API_KEY`, the API key will be `undefined`, leading to API call failures.
    *   **Suggestion:** Verify your build tool's environment variable configuration and adjust accordingly.

*   **Generic Error Messages:**
    *   **Issue:** The error messages like "Prompt optimization failed. Please check your API key and try again." are generic. While helpful, they don't provide specific details from the caught error, making debugging harder.
    *   **Suggestion:** Consider logging more specific error details in `console.error` and optionally displaying more granular messages to the user if the error object provides actionable information. For example, if an error has a `code` or `message` property from the API, you could use that.

## 2. Performance

*   **Polling Interval for Video Generation:**
    The `generateVideoFromText` function polls every 10 seconds. While this might be acceptable for a demo, it's a fixed interval that could lead to longer waits than necessary or excessive polling for very long generations.
    *   **Issue:** A fixed 10-second poll might be too slow for short generations or too frequent for very long ones.
    *   **Suggestion:** Implement an exponential backoff strategy for polling. Start with a shorter interval (e.g., 2-5 seconds) and increase it with each retry, up to a maximum interval, to be more efficient.
        ```typescript
        // Inside generateVideoFromText
        let delay = 2000; // Start with 2 seconds
        const maxDelay = 30000; // Max 30 seconds
        const backoffFactor = 1.5;

        while (!operation.done) {
          console.log('...Generating...');
          await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
          operation = await ai.operations.getVideosOperation({operation});
          delay = Math.min(maxDelay, delay * backoffFactor); // Increase delay
        }
        ```

*   **Video Data URL Storage (Base64):**
    Storing full video data as Base64 encoded strings (`data:video/mp4;base64,...`) directly in the React state (`videoUrl` of `Video` objects) is a **major performance and memory concern**.
    *   **Issue:** Base64 encoding increases data size by about 33%. Storing large video files this way in memory will consume significant RAM, making the application slow, unresponsive, and potentially crashing if many videos are generated. Each re-render of components consuming this state will also process large strings. It also limits the maximum size of videos that can be handled.
    *   **Suggestion:**
        1.  **Prefer Blob URLs:** After fetching the blob, create a `URL.createObjectURL(blob)`. These URLs are short, memory-efficient, and allow the browser to manage the underlying binary data. Remember to `URL.revokeObjectURL()` when the video is no longer needed to release memory.
        2.  **External Storage (Production):** For a production application, generated videos should be stored in cloud storage (e.g., Google Cloud Storage, S3) and their public URLs stored in the `videoUrl` property. This offloads storage and serving from the client application.
    *   **Before:**
        ```typescript
        // ... in handleGenerateFromPrompt and handleSaveEdit
        const mimeType = 'video/mp4';
        const videoSrc = videoObjects[0]; // This is the Base64 string
        const src = `data:${mimeType};base64,${videoSrc}`; // Full Base64 data URL
        // ...
        const newVideo: Video = {
          id: self.crypto.randomUUID(),
          title: newVideoTitle,
          description: prompt,
          videoUrl: src, // Storing large Base64 string here
        };
        ```
    *   **After (using Blob URLs - client-side):**
        ```typescript
        // In generateVideoFromText
        // Change return type to Promise<URL[]> or Promise<Blob[]>
        // For simplicity, let's keep it as string[] for now, but the string would be a blob URL.
        return await Promise.all(
          videos.map(async (generatedVideo: GeneratedVideo) => {
            const url = decodeURIComponent(generatedVideo.video.uri);
            const res = await fetch(`${url}&key=${process.env.API_KEY}`);
            if (!res.ok) {
              throw new Error(
                `Failed to fetch video: ${res.status} ${res.statusText}`,
              );
            }
            const blob = await res.blob();
            return URL.createObjectURL(blob); // Return Blob URL instead of Base64
          }),
        );

        // ... In handleGenerateFromPrompt and handleSaveEdit
        // videoObjects[0] would now be a Blob URL
        const videoSrcUrl = videoObjects[0]; 

        const newVideo: Video = {
          id: self.crypto.randomUUID(),
          title: newVideoTitle,
          description: prompt,
          videoUrl: videoSrcUrl, // Store the Blob URL
        };
        // Add a useEffect or cleanup logic to call URL.revokeObjectURL(videoSrcUrl) when video is no longer needed.
        // For example, when a video is removed from `videos` state or when the component unmounts.
        ```
        This change would require more careful state management for revoking URLs, but it's crucial for performance.

*   **`MOCK_VIDEOS` Size:**
    If `MOCK_VIDEOS` contains many large Base64 encoded video strings, it will also contribute to high initial memory usage and slower component initialization.
    *   **Suggestion:** For mock data, use smaller dummy URLs or only a few very small videos.

## 3. Security

*   **CRITICAL: API Key Exposure on Client-Side:**
    This is the most significant security vulnerability in the current code. Your `GoogleGenAI` API key is directly embedded in the client-side JavaScript bundle (`new GoogleGenAI({apiKey: process.env.API_KEY});`) and also appended to `fetch` requests (`fetch(`${url}&key=${process.env.API_KEY}`);`).
    *   **Issue:** Anyone with access to the client-side code (e.g., by inspecting network requests or viewing the source) can extract your API key. This key can then be used by malicious actors to incur costs on your Google Cloud account, access your data, or abuse the AI service.
    *   **Solution:** **Never expose API keys for paid or sensitive services directly on the client-side.**
        1.  **Backend Proxy (Recommended):** The most secure approach is to set up a simple backend server that acts as a proxy.
            *   The client sends requests to your backend.
            *   Your backend receives the request, adds the API key (which is securely stored on the server and never exposed to the client), and forwards the request to the Google GenAI API.
            *   The backend then sends the response back to the client.
        2.  **Environment Variables (Less secure for sensitive keys, but better than hardcoding):** Ensure `process.env.API_KEY` is loaded *during the build process* into the client bundle *only if* the API key is safe to be client-side. Google AI keys are generally *not* safe for client-side. The current usage *exposes* it.
    *   **Example (Conceptual Backend Proxy - Node.js/Express):**
        ```javascript
        // server.js (Node.js/Express)
        const express = require('express');
        const cors = require('cors');
        const { GoogleGenAI } = require('@google/genai');
        require('dotenv').config(); // For process.env.API_KEY on the server

        const app = express();
        app.use(cors()); // Configure CORS appropriately for your domain
        app.use(express.json());

        const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: process.env.API_KEY }); // API key safe on server

        app.post('/api/generate-video', async (req, res) => {
          try {
            const { prompt, numberOfVideos } = req.body;
            // Your generateVideoFromText logic, using the server-side `ai` instance
            // Do not pass the API key to the client for the generated video URI fetch
            const operation = await ai.models.generateVideos({
              model: 'veo-3.0-fast-generate-001',
              prompt,
              config: { numberOfVideos, aspectRatio: '16:9' },
            });
            // Polling logic would also be on the server
            while (!operation.done) {
              await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 10000));
              console.log('...Generating on server...');
              operation = await ai.operations.getVideosOperation({ operation });
            }

            if (operation?.response?.generatedVideos) {
                // IMPORTANT: The video URIs might be short-lived or signed. 
                // Consider if the server should directly fetch and proxy the video blob,
                // or if the URI can be safely returned to the client for direct download.
                // For direct download, ensure the URI itself is secure (e.g., signed URL).
                const videoUris = operation.response.generatedVideos.map(v => v.video.uri);
                res.json({ videoUris }); // Client fetches directly if URIs are public/signed
            } else {
                res.status(500).json({ error: 'No videos generated' });
            }
          } catch (error) {
            console.error('Server video generation error:', error);
            res.status(500).json({ error: 'Video generation failed on server.' });
          }
        });

        // Similar endpoint for /api/optimize-prompt
        app.post('/api/optimize-prompt', async (req, res) => {
            try {
                const { prompt } = req.body;
                const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
                    model: 'gemini-2.5-flash',
                    contents: [{ type: 'text', text: prompt }],
                    config: {
                        systemInstruction: "You are a creative assistant...",
                    },
                });
                const optimizedPrompt = (await response.text()).trim();
                res.json({ optimizedPrompt });
            } catch (error) {
                console.error('Server prompt optimization error:', error);
                res.status(500).json({ error: 'Prompt optimization failed on server.' });
            }
        });

        const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3001;
        app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));
        ```
        The client-side code would then fetch from `/api/generate-video` on your own domain, eliminating API key exposure.

*   **CORS Configuration:**
    If you implement a backend proxy, remember to configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) on your backend to allow requests from your frontend domain.

*   **Input Sanitization for Displayed Prompts:**
    While prompts sent to an LLM are usually safe, if the generated `newVideoTitle` or `description` (which are based on the prompt) were ever rendered directly as HTML (e.g., using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`), it could lead to XSS vulnerabilities if the prompt contained malicious script tags.
    *   **Current Status:** The code appears to render these as plain text (e.g., `VideoPlayer` or `EditVideoPage` would typically put them into `<h1>` or `<p>` tags as text content).
    *   **Suggestion:** Always render user-provided content as plain text or sanitize it if it must be rendered as HTML. React generally protects against XSS by escaping text content, but it's a good practice to be aware of.

---

## 4. Best Practices & Readability

*   **Consistent `async`/`await` Usage:**
    Ensure `async` is only used when `await` is genuinely needed or when explicitly returning a Promise.
    *   **Issue:** As noted in the bugs section, `async` in `bloblToBase64`'s `Promise` constructor executor is an anti-pattern.

*   **Error Handling in `catch` Blocks:**
    The `error` variable in `catch (error)` blocks is implicitly typed as `any`.
    *   **Suggestion:** Type `error` as `unknown` and use type narrowing to handle specific error types or access properties safely.
        ```typescript
        try {
          // ...
        } catch (error: unknown) {
          if (error instanceof Error) {
            console.error('Video generation failed:', error.message);
            // More detailed messages
          } else {
            console.error('An unknown error occurred:', error);
          }
          setGenerationError([
            'Video generation failed.',
            'Please check your API key and try again.',
          ]);
        }
        ```

*   **`useState` Initialization for `suggestedPrompts`:**
    Using a functional update for `useState` when the initial state calculation is expensive or needs to run only once is a good practice.
    *   **Current Code:**
        ```typescript
        const [suggestedPrompts] = useState<string[]>(() => {
          const shuffled = [...promptSuggestions].sort(() => 0.5 - Math.random());
          return shuffled.slice(0, 3);
        });
        ```
    *   **Review:** This is excellent! It ensures `shuffled.slice(0, 3)` only runs once on initial render, preventing unnecessary re-calculations.

*   **Semantic HTML and Accessibility (A11y):**
    *   **Current Status:** Good use of `htmlFor`, `aria-label`, `aria-live`. The loading spinners are well-implemented with `aria-live="polite"`.
    *   **Suggestion:** For `div` elements acting as buttons or interactive elements (e.g., `suggestedPrompts` buttons), ensure they have `role="button"` and are keyboard navigable. The current buttons are native `<button>` elements, which is good.

*   **Clear State Variables:**
    State variables like `isSaving`, `isOptimizing`, `playingVideo`, `editingVideo` are well-named and reflect their purpose.

*   **Redundant Checks:**
    In `generateVideoFromText`:
    *   **Issue:** `if (operation?.response)` followed by `const videos = operation.response?.generatedVideos;` and then `if (videos === undefined || videos.length === 0)`. The `operation?.response` check makes `operation.response` non-nullish inside the block.
    *   **Before:**
        ```typescript
        if (operation?.response) {
            const videos = operation.response?.generatedVideos;
            if (videos === undefined || videos.length === 0) {
                throw new Error('No videos generated');
            }
            // ...
        } else {
            throw new Error('No videos generated');
        }
        ```
    *   **After:**
        ```typescript
        if (!operation?.response?.generatedVideos || operation.response.generatedVideos.length === 0) {
          throw new Error('No videos generated');
        }
        const videos = operation.response.generatedVideos; // Now safe to access
        // ...
        ```

*   **`console.log` Statements:**
    *   **Issue:** Several `console.log` statements are used for debugging.
    *   **Suggestion:** For production builds, consider removing these or using a logging library that can strip them out, or making them conditional on `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'`.

---

## 5. Maintainability

*   **Component Logic Separation (`App` Component):**
    The `App` component currently handles all state, API calls, and rendering logic. While acceptable for smaller applications, as the app grows, this can become a "God component."
    *   **Suggestion:** Consider extracting related logic into custom hooks or smaller, more focused components.
        *   `useVideoOperations`: Could encapsulate `generateVideoFromText`, `handleGenerateFromPrompt`, `handleSaveEdit`, and related `isSaving`/`generationError` states.
        *   `usePromptOptimization`: For `handleOptimizePrompt` and `isOptimizing` state.
    *   **Example (Conceptual `useVideoOperations` hook):**
        ```typescript
        // hooks/useVideoOperations.ts
        import { useState, useCallback } from 'react';
        import { GoogleGenAI, GeneratedVideo } from '@google/genai';
        import { Video } from '../types'; // Adjust path
        import { VEO_MODEL_NAME } from '../constants'; // Adjust path
        // Assume ai is initialized externally or passed in
        // IMPORTANT: In a real app, AI client should be created via backend proxy.
        const ai = new GoogleGenAI({apiKey: process.env.API_KEY}); 

        interface UseVideoOperationsResult {
          isSaving: boolean;
          generationError: string[] | null;
          generateVideo: (prompt: string, originalVideo?: Video) => Promise<Video | undefined>;
        }

        async function generateVideoFromText(
          prompt: string,
          numberOfVideos = 1,
        ): Promise<string[]> { /* ... existing logic ... */ } // This would return Blob URLs

        export const useVideoOperations = (): UseVideoOperationsResult => {
          const [isSaving, setIsSaving] = useState(false);
          const [generationError, setGenerationError] = useState<string[] | null>(null);

          const generateVideo = useCallback(async (prompt: string, originalVideo?: Video) => {
            setIsSaving(true);

*   **Constants and Configuration:**
    `VEO_MODEL_NAME` is a good example of a constant. Ensure `gemini-2.5-flash` for prompt optimization is also defined as a constant if it's likely to change.
    *   **Suggestion:** Create a `config.ts` file for all such magic strings and API-related configurations.

*   **Type Definitions (`Video`):**
    The `Video` interface is well-defined and used consistently. This significantly aids maintainability.

*   **API Integration Logic:**
    The functions `bloblToBase64` and `generateVideoFromText` encapsulate API interaction details well. They are reusable and focused.

*   **Clarity on `MOCK_VIDEOS`:**
    *   **Current Status:** `MOCK_VIDEOS` is directly used for the initial state.
    *   **Suggestion:** For a production-ready application, `MOCK_VIDEOS` should be replaced with data loaded from a real API or removed entirely if the app is solely for generating videos. A clear flag or environment variable could control whether mocks are used.
